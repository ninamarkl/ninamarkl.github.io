<p>I am a researcher working at the intersection of sociolinguistics, speech technologies and AI ethics. I am particularly interested in language variation and change and the impact of speech technologies on speech communities. More broadly, I am interested in understanding the socio-technical contexts and impacts of computing technologies, in particular machine learning and "artificial intelligence".</p>

<p>I am a (socio)linguist and (somewhat skeptical) computer scientist by training, but have a strong interest in science and technology studies, sociology and political studies. In my work I try to bring different fields, and different researchers, into conversation. Within and outwith academia, I'm committed to collaboration to foster sustainable, anti-racist and supportive learning, working and living environments. </p>

<p>I work as a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/institute-for-analytics-and-data-science" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Institute for Analytics and Data Science</a> and the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/language-and-linguistics" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Language and Linguistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in Colchester, in south-east England.</p>

<p>Before moving to England, I was a student and (part-time) tutor and research assistant at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. My PhD research was supervised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/clai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Catherine Lai</a> and <a href="https://www.laurenhall-lew.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof Lauren Hall-Lew</a> at the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UKRI CDT for NLP</a> at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
